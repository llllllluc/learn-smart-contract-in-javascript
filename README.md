## Overview and Comparison
There aren't much chains supporting JS contract. In fact NEAR is the only one supporting JS in production, both Mina and Agoric are still in testnet for their JS contract. So NEAR is obviously the most mature one, even though JS is not NEAR's main smart contract language (Rust is). 

But in the long term, I expect the dev experience for Mina and Agoric to catch up. Today you cannot find much examples and tooling is lacking, but they both provide something new comparing to traditional smart contract (Mina enables you to build private app by zk proof, i.e. data does not need to be on chain. Agoric enables you to build "secure" js contracts).

## Conclusion
If you want to use JS to write smart contract, I would just recommend you to pick another language like RustðŸ˜‚.
